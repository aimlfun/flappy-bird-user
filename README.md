# flappy-bird-user

This is from my blog https://aimlfun.com/anyone-for-flappy-bird/, where we create a neural network
to control Flappy. 
There is a separate code-base for the "AI" version also available at https://github.com/aimlfun/flappy-bird-ai

The code-base is a less than bare-bones mimimum logic app. It's not intended to be fully functioning so please don't complain. I wanted to test Flappy against the
random course, along with scrolling and collision detection. At best, it's a demo of parallax scrolling.

Press [ENTER] to make Flappy to upwards. Don't do it too much. 

If you crash into a pipe, it stops responding and falls to the bottom. The score is at the top of the form. Restart the game and try again.
